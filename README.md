# Auto_FineTunningLLM

## Overview

This repository contains resources and codebase for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically for medical applications, utilizing the Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) technique. Our goal is to enhance the model's understanding and generation capabilities related to medical texts, improving its performance on tasks such as medical question answering and documentation.
